INTRODUCTION
============

This is a very basic Vim plugin (my first) based on Merginal/Nerdtree.  It opens up a window on the side of the screen that allows you to pick a different git repository/project to work on.  It then opens up a base level file in that directory and optionally cleans up your buffers to limit the scope of your work to that new project.
